First of all:
set correct SDK/NDK/compiler paths in the lib_sundog/sundog_makefile.inc

Android:
1) run resources/collect_android_resources; this will create the following files:
  * android_project/app/src/main/res/raw/files - ZIP with all Pixilang examples; this file will be unpacked into the app internal storage on the first start;
  * android_project/app/src/main/res/raw/hash - hash of the above file;
2) run MAKE_ANDROID; this will compile the Pixilang native code (android_project/app/src/main/jniLibs)
3) open android_project/ in Android Studio and build the APK.

iOS:
open ios_project/ in XCode and build the app.

macOS:
open macos_project/ in XCode and build the app.

Other systems:
just use one of the MAKE_* scripts in Linux/macOS Terminal;
the built version of the app will be copied to one of the bin/* folders

When the build is finished:
make clean

Requirements:
make, gcc, MinGW (Windows), Android NDK
Linux libs: libsdl2-dev, libasound2-dev, libjack-jackd2-dev
